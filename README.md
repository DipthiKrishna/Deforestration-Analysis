# Global Deforestation Analysis (1990-2016) with SQL
Welcome to the Global Deforestation Analysis project!   
This repository hosts datasets and SQL queries to conduct a comprehensive analysis of deforestation trends worldwide from 1990 to 2016. The analysis utilizes the datasets provided in the dataset folder.

## Introduction
This project focuses on understanding and visualizing the global deforestation trends over a 26-year period. By leveraging SQL queries on the datasets **(forest_area, land_area,** and **regions)**, we aim to uncover insights into the scale, causes, and implications of deforestation across different regions.

## Datasets
The analysis employs three datasets:

**Forest_Area**: Contains data on forested areas across various regions and years.  
**Land_Area**: Provides information about the total land area of different regions and years.  
**Regions**: Offers details about the geographic regions being analyzed.  

## SQL Queries
The SQL queries can be found in the queries folder. Each query file is named descriptively to reflect the analysis it performs on the datasets. Executing these queries on your SQL database will yield valuable insights.  

**Getting Started**  
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:  

**bash**  
Copy code  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-deforestation-analysis.git  
Database Setup: Import the dataset files from the dataset folder into your SQL database.  

**Running Queries**: Use your preferred SQL client to execute the queries in the queries folder. These queries delve into deforestation trends, causes, and regional comparisons.

**Usage**
Explore the results of SQL queries to gain an in-depth understanding of global deforestation patterns and trends. Feel free to adapt and expand the queries to extract further insights.

**Contributing**
Contributions to enhance the analysis, queries, or datasets are encouraged. For suggestions or improvements, open an issue or submit a pull request.

**License**
This project is licensed under Udacity.

Let's utilize the power of SQL to unravel the story of global deforestation between 1990 and 2016. Together, we can contribute to better insights and awareness for a greener future.  

Happy querying!
